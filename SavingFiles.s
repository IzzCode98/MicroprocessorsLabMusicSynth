;How to make new files:
    ; right click on 'Source Files' and click 'New' > 'AssemblyFile.S' 
    ;name file appropriately
    
;How to save new files:
    ; FIRST you must right click on the file and select 'Git' > 'Commit' 
    ; THEN you can click 'Push upstream' 
    ; if this still doesn't show in your GitHub, then click 'Push' and go through the steps
    
;In order to save any changes you must always do Git Commit FIRST then Push
    ; Alternatively, you can click the Team tab and click Commit there, and then Push

;Note that if the file is 'green' it is because you have note yet committed/saved changes

;Note that if you change file names on MPLab, this saves to GitHub as a new file:
	;therefore you must go to GitHub and delete the file with the old file name manually
	;this applies to any files you want deleted, deleting them on MPLab will NOT delete them on GitHub
